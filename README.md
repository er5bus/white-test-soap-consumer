## Application that consume our Soap web service whitespace tests at TEK-UP

# Eaxm
We are going to develop a soap web service to book the whitespace tests at TEK-UP.
1) Using the attached xsd file, develop the soap web service.
- Ensure a list of students and exams for the tests.
- Return an answer with a precise date if everything goes well. (fig1)
- Modify the xsd file to return an error if necessary. (fig2)
2) Change the address attribute from a string type to a complex type Address which contains the
elements : street, city, postcode.
3) Develop another service that returns the list of available tests.
4) Develop another application to be the consumer of our web service.
